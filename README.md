# My Emacs Configuration

This is my Emacs configuration, largely inspired by Sebastian Wiesner's (now archived) [configuration](https://github.com/lunaryorn/old-emacs-configuration). This config offers improved defaults, and extended support for the following:

* Scala (without ENSIME)
* Python
* Org-mode

## Emacs Versions

I've only tested this on (vanilla) Emacs 26.1 for MacOS.
